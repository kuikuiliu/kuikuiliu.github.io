I am a mathematician/computer scientist in the [Theory Group](https://toc.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT EECS. I was previously a [FODSI](https://fodsi.us/) postdoctoral fellow at MIT CSAIL hosted by [Ankur Moitra](https://people.csail.mit.edu/moitra/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington, where I was extremely fortunate to be advised by [Shayan Oveis Gharan](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shayan/). I am interested in the design and analysis of sampling algorithms for high-dimensional probability distributions. I like thinking about Markov chain mixing times, statistical physics, and the geometry of polynomials.

My dissertation can be found [here](/files/dissertation.pdf).
