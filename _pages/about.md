I am a mathematician/computer scientist in the [Theory Group](https://toc.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT EECS, where I hold the Elting Morison Career Development Chair. I was previously a [FODSI](https://fodsi.us/) postdoctoral fellow at MIT CSAIL hosted by [Ankur Moitra](https://people.csail.mit.edu/moitra/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington, where I was extremely fortunate to be advised by [Shayan Oveis Gharan](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shayan/). I am interested in the design and analysis of sampling algorithms for high-dimensional probability distributions. I like thinking about Markov chain mixing times, statistical physics, and the geometry of polynomials.

My dissertation can be found [here](/files/dissertation.pdf).

I am currently working with the following excellent graduate students:
- [Francisco Pernice](https://sites.google.com/view/franciscopernice/home) (coadvised with [David Gamarnik](https://web.mit.edu/gamarnik/www/home.html))
- [Amit Rajaraman](https://amitrajaraman.github.io/) (coadvised with [Sam Hopkins](https://www.samuelbhopkins.com/))
- [Daniel Lee](https://dan-iel-lee.github.io/)
